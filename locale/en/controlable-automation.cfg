[mod-setting-name]
advanced-circuit-network-update-interval=Update interval [img=utility/warning_icon]

[mod-setting-description]
advanced-circuit-network-update-interval=Update interval in ticks.\n\n[img=utility/warning_icon] If the update is not done every tick, enabling machines and triggering a launch with a pulse signal won't be reliable anymore. Output pulses will still work.\n\nRecommended value for normal base: 1\nRecommended value for megabase: 12
